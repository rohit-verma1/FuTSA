# Final Submission

This repository contains the final submission for the project analyzing air quality data, with a focus on PM10 levels and their variations.

## Contents

- **final_submission.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis and visualizations.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels

## Usage

2. Install the required libraries.
3. Open `final_submission.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells to see the analysis and visualizations.

## Description

The notebook includes the following key steps:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Time series analysis of PM10 levels
- Calculation of Air Quality Index (AQI)
